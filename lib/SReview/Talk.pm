=head1 NAME

SReview::Talk - Database abstraction for talks in the SReview database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SReview::Talk;

  my $talk = SReview::Talk->new(talkid => 1);
  print $talk->nonce;
  my $nonce = $talk->nonce;
  my $talk_alt = SReview::Talk->by_nonce($nonce);
  print $talk_alt->talkid; # 1

  $talk->add_correction(length_adj => 1);
  $talk->done_correcting;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SReview::Talk provides a (Moose-based) object-oriented interface to the
data related to a talk that is stored in the SReview database. Although
it is not yet used everywhere, the intention is for it to eventually
replace all the direct PostgreSQL calls.

=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 talkid

The unique ID of the talk. Required attribute at construction time (but
see the C<by_nonce> method, below). Is used to look up the relevant data
in the database.

=cut

has 'talkid' => (
	required => 1,
	is => 'ro',
        trigger => sub {
                my $self = shift;

                die "Talk does not exist.\n" unless $st->rows == 1;
        },
);

=head2 pathinfo

Helper property to look up information from the database. Should not be
used directly.

=cut

=head2 state_done

Set the progress to "done" in the given state. Does nothing if the talk
has since moved to another state.

}

=head2 reset_corrections

Clear all corrections, except the serial one. Used when a user requests
that the talk be reset to default.

=cut
