  * New upstream release, featuring:
    - Much less bugs (which were discovered after a production run at
      FOSDEM)
    - More flexibility in certain areas, needed by the above production
      run
    - Better documentation (thanks Nattie!)
    - Working support for JSON export to Stefano Rivera's youtube upload
      tool
    - A new state for "ignored" talks (i.e., content that is not
      interesting)
    - Default to self-installed jQuery and bootstrap libraries, rather
      than using CDN-provided ones
    - ... and much more!
