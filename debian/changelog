      for comfort...).

  * The "FOSDEM is coming" release.
  * New upstream release, with lots of new and updated features; most

sreview (0.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "DebConf is a wrap" release.
  * New upstream release. New features:
    - Support for fully automatic review, through "sreview-autoreview".
      Useful if markers are used, or start/stop positions are created
      out of band (SReview is reduced to just a transcoder then).
    - Audio normalization is now a module that has multiple
      implementations: bs1770gain (the default for backcompat reasons),
      ffmpeg (using ffmpeg's "loudnorm" filter), and none (no audio
      normalization)
    - A/V synchronization is now a module, too.
    - New state: final review, for reviewing the videos post-transcode
      (in case there are errors there).
    - The old review form is now completely gone. It was already no
      longer active and probably didn't work anymore, but the code was
      still there.
    - Added the ability to pre-generate and preview (on a single page)
      all the credit slides.
    - Plus a bunch of smaller improvements and bug fixes.

  * debian/tests/control: drop. We can't get the autopkgtest to work
